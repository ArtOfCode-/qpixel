  before_action :auth_for_voting

  # Authenticated web action. Casts a vote on behalf of a user. This is just about the most complex action in the application. Forbids
  # self-voting by default, but this is configurable by site setting. Also prevents duplicate votes of the same type by
  # the same user on one post; handles a user changing their vote, and deals with re-calculating post scores and user
  # reputation after the vote has been cast.
  #
  # Intended as an API action to be called from client-side JavaScript, rather than to be directly accessed - this
  # is only accessible on a POST route, and returns JSON for further client-side processing.
