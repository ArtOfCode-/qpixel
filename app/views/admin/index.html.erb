<h3>Admin Dashboard</h3>
<p>This page serves as a repository of links to the various tools you have access to as an administrative user. While
  you use these, remember that the data in them is usually admin- or moderator-only, and should likely not be shared
  with anyone outside of those teams unless you've ensured it's safe to share.</p>

<h5><strong>Safe to Share</strong></h5>
<p>Although for the most part, the information available under the /admin routes is sensitive or confidential, there are
  cases where it's beneficial to share the information. If you're going to do this, make sure it's safe to share.
  In general terms, this means that the information you share:</p>
<ul>
  <li>should not make it easier to circumvent the system - if you know details of systems that are generally not very
    well-known, it's best to keep them secret so the system can't be circumvented</li>
  <li>should not contain private details of <em>any</em> user</li>
  <li>should not be discourteous to anyone - talk and speculation of bans and removals is inconsiderate to a user who
    can't respond</li>
</ul>
<p>Apply common sense - think of what effect this information will have before you share it. If in doubt, check it with
  another member of your team.</p>
